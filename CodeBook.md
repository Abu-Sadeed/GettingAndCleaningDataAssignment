## Code Book
This is the explanation of variables used to create independent_tidy_data 
### Data Set Information
The activities are labeled in 6 names (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) taken from "activity_labels.txt" file. The features are taken from "fetures.txt" file from dataset and "futures.info" contains information about them.

### Variable Information
The dataset contains: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An id of the subject who carried out the experiment.
